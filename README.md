# jsla upcoming speakers and abstracts 
## because we really want your talk

This repo lets us more easily track [jsla](http://js.la)
talks.

If you're thinking about submitting a talk, fork this repo, add your abstract and info to `/proposals/<your talk>`, 
then send a pull request.  A jsla organizer will then contact you to schedule.

See the [sample file](https://github.com/jsla/abstracts/blob/master/propsals/sample.md) for an example proposal.
